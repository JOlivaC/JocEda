# multi-tournament
Multi-tournament is a Java application that models various players competing in a programmable ranked game.

The system acts as a Server and allows participants to submit their code-like players into a specific game. 

The system pairs and plays matches between players to determine the winner. The winner gets points and ranks up.

## Usage
You can compile and run the programs with the Java Virtual Machine.

* The client is a Java application which lets you submit your code-players to the server.
* The server collects the players from different clients and runs the whole tournament logic.
